word_seg
========

Word segmentation data from Frank et al. (2010), Cognition

These are the original tabular data from the project. A few notes:
- The original analyses were in matlab and were somewhat baroque - instead analysis.R is a very simple R reproduction of the behavioral data analysis. If you want the models and full codebase, look here: https://github.com/langcog/seg_compare
- The subject ids are not unique across experiments, so be careful in merging datasets
- Please email mcfrank@stanford.edu for more details
